# --- Obfuscation Name Pairs ---
# Can also replace key words.
# e.g. can be used to comment out code like perfectly valid (KCMM commented out) entry:
# translateAll(0F, 0F, 0F); - //translateAll(0F, 0F, 0F);
# '#' is recognised as commenting by KCMM but '//' is commenting recognised by the Java programming language which is still included in this example
# However in this KCMM version if you double up on performing a de/obfuscation action it will continue to add more '//' to the front of translateAll(...); so watch out on some replace actions.
